EVENTS WITH JAVASCRIPT

What is an Event?

When you refresh your email inbox, double tap on a post, or scroll through a newsfeed,
something cool happens in your browser. These actions are known as events!

Events on the web are user interactions and browser manipulations that you can program
to trigger functionality. Some other examples of events are:

A mouse clicking on a button
Webpage files loading in the browser
A user swiping right on an image
When a user does any of the above actions, they’re causing the event to be fired or be triggered.
As in, “a click event fired when the button was clicked”. Being able to respond to these events
makes your website interactive and therefore dynamic.
