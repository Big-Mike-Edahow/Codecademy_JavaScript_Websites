Adding Event Handlers

We looked at registering event handlers using the .addEventListener() method, but there is also another way!

Event Handlers can also be registered by setting an .onevent property on a DOM element (event target). The pattern for registering a specific event is to append an element with .on followed by the lowercased event type name.
